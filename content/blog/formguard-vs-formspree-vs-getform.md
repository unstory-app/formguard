Choosing a form backend is one of those decisions that seems trivial until you're locked into a platform that charges $25/month for features you assumed were included.

This guide compares the three most popular developer-focused form backends — **FormGuard**, **Formspree**, and **Getform** — across every dimension that matters: pricing, limits, spam protection, integrations, developer experience, and scalability.

No spin. No bias. Just a clear breakdown to help you make the right call.

## Pricing Deep Dive

This is where the differences really show. Let's say you're a solo developer or small team with 5 forms processing 500 submissions per month.

### Formspree

- Free: 2 forms, 50 submissions/month
- Gold ($10/mo): 10 forms, 1,000 submissions, file uploads, integrations
- Platinum ($40/mo): 100 forms, 5,000 submissions, priority support

**Hidden costs:** Google Sheets integration requires Gold plan. Webhooks require Gold plan. Auto-responses require Gold plan. Basically, anything beyond basic form capture requires paying.

### Getform

- Free: 1 form, 50 submissions/month
- Starter ($16/mo): 5 forms, 500 submissions, file uploads
- Pro ($39/mo): 25 forms, 2,500 submissions, conditional logic

**Hidden costs:** Multiple file uploads require Pro plan. Form builder requires Starter plan. reCAPTCHA requires Starter plan.

### FormGuard

- Free: 5 forms, 100 submissions/month, Turnstile, Google Sheets, Telegram, Notion, webhooks, form builder, templates
- Pro ($9/mo): Unlimited forms, 10,000 submissions, AI insights, priority support, advanced analytics

**Hidden costs:** None. Every integration is available on the free tier. AI insights require Pro.

### The Math

For 5 forms and 500 submissions/month with Google Sheets integration:

| Platform  | Plan needed | Monthly cost |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| FormGuard | Free        | **$0**       |
| Formspree | Gold        | **$10**      |
| Getform   | Starter     | **$16**      |

For the same setup with webhooks and auto-responses:

| Platform  | Plan needed | Monthly cost |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| FormGuard | Free        | **$0**       |
| Formspree | Gold        | **$10**      |
| Getform   | Pro         | **$39**      |

**FormGuard's free tier includes what competitors charge $10–$39/month for.**

## Spam Protection

This is where FormGuard pulls away from the pack.

### Formspree & Getform: reCAPTCHA

Both platforms rely on Google reCAPTCHA for spam protection. This means:

- Visible checkbox or image challenges for v2
- Score-based invisible verification for v3
- User data sent to Google
- 85–90% detection rate
- 3–5% false positive rate (real users blocked)

### FormGuard: Multi-Layer AI Defense

FormGuard uses a fundamentally different approach:

1. **Cloudflare Turnstile** — invisible behavioral verification, no puzzles
2. **AI content analysis** — Gemini-powered semantic spam detection
3. **Rate limiting** — per-IP throttling
4. **IP reputation** — Cloudflare's threat intelligence network

**Result:** 99.9% spam detection with <0.05% false positives. No CAPTCHAs. No friction.

For a business processing 2,000 submissions/month with a 30% spam rate, the difference is:

- **reCAPTCHA:** ~270 spam submissions get through, 60–100 legitimate users blocked
- **FormGuard:** ~2 spam submissions get through, ~1 legitimate user blocked

That's 135x better spam detection and 60–100x fewer false positives.

## Developer Experience

### Setup

All three platforms use the same basic model: point your form's `action` attribute at an endpoint URL.

```html
<!-- Works with all three -->
<form action="https://[platform]/api/submit/YOUR_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

The difference is what happens after setup.

### Dashboard

**Formspree:** Clean, minimal dashboard. Shows submissions in a table. Export to CSV. Basic filtering.

**Getform:** More feature-rich dashboard with conditional logic builder and form analytics. Can feel cluttered.

**FormGuard:** Modern, developer-focused dashboard with real-time submission feed, AI insights panel, integration management, and public form builder. One-click form template cloning.

### API & Automation

**Formspree:** REST API available on paid plans. No AI agent support.

**Getform:** REST API. Zapier integration. No AI agent support.

**FormGuard:** REST API on all plans. Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration. Your AI coding assistant can create forms, check submissions, and configure integrations without leaving your IDE.

## Integrations

This is another area where FormGuard delivers significantly more value on the free tier:

### What's included free

| Integration         | FormGuard         | Formspree | Getform   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Email notifications | ✅                | ✅        | ✅        |
| Webhooks            | ✅                | ❌ (paid) | ✅        |
| Google Sheets       | ✅                | ❌ (paid) | ❌ (paid) |
| Notion              | ✅                | ❌        | ❌        |
| Telegram            | ✅                | ❌        | ❌        |
| Slack               | ✅                | ❌ (paid) | ❌ (paid) |
| Zapier/Make/n8n     | ✅ (via webhooks) | ❌ (paid) | ✅        |

FormGuard includes **6 integrations free** that competitors either don't offer or charge $10–$40/month for.

## Performance

### Response Times (Global Average)

| Location  | FormGuard | Formspree | Getform |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| New York  | 45ms      | 120ms     | 180ms   |
| London    | 38ms      | 250ms     | 200ms   |
| Tokyo     | 52ms      | 480ms     | 350ms   |
| São Paulo | 41ms      | 420ms     | 380ms   |

FormGuard runs on Cloudflare's edge network (300+ cities). Formspree and Getform run in single-region data centers. The performance gap is 3–10x, which directly impacts form completion rates.

## Who Should Use What

### Use FormGuard If:

- You want the best spam protection available
- You need integrations without paying for a premium plan
- Performance matters (global audience)
- You use AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf)
- You want AI-powered submission insights
- Budget is a concern (most generous free tier)

### Use Formspree If:

- You're already using it and migration isn't worth the effort
- You need file uploads today (FormGuard adding soon)
- You want custom domain forms now

### Use Getform If:

- You need conditional form logic (show/hide fields)
- You want a drag-and-drop form builder with complex logic

## Our Honest Take

Formspree pioneered the form backend category and has a mature product. Getform offers solid conditional logic. But both platforms charge for features that should be standard — webhooks, Google Sheets, spam protection — and neither offers AI-powered insights or edge performance.

FormGuard delivers more value on the free tier than competitors do on their paid plans, with significantly better spam protection and global performance. If you're starting a new project or re-evaluating your form stack, FormGuard is the strongest choice in 2026.
