It's 2 AM in your timezone. A prospect in Tokyo fills out your demo request form. What happens next?

**Option A (Manual):** Nothing. The submission sits in your inbox until 9 AM. By then, the prospect has moved on.

**Option B (Automated):** Within 2 seconds, the lead is saved to Google Sheets, a Notion database entry is created, your sales team gets a Telegram ping, and the prospect receives a personalized auto-response with a link to book a demo.

Option B closes deals. Here's how to build it.

## The Architecture

A fully automated lead pipeline has four components:

```
Form Submit → FormGuard → Integrations → Follow-up
                              ↓
                    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
                    │         │         │
              Google Sheets  Notion   Telegram
                    │         │         │
                    └─────────┼─────────┘
                              ↓
                    Webhook → Auto-responder
```

FormGuard handles the first two layers (capture + routing) natively. The auto-responder layer uses a webhook connection to your email service.

**Total setup time: 10 minutes. Zero code required.**

## Step 1: Create Your Form (2 minutes)

### Option A: Use a Template

1. Log into FormGuard → Dashboard
2. Scroll to **Quick Start Templates**
3. Click **"Use"** on the Contact Form or Waitlist template
4. You're done — the form is live with pre-configured fields

### Option B: Create Custom

1. Click **"New Form"** in the dashboard
2. Name it (e.g., "Demo Requests Q1")
3. Go to the **Public** tab to add custom fields
4. Configure field labels, types, and validation

Either way, you now have a unique submission endpoint URL.

## Step 2: Wire Up Google Sheets (2 minutes)

Every lead should live in a spreadsheet for pipeline tracking:

1. Create a Google Sheet for your leads
2. Share it with FormGuard (instructions in the Integrations tab)
3. Paste the Sheet URL in **Integrations → Google Sheets**
4. Click **Save**

Now every submission auto-appends as a new row. Columns match your form field names automatically.

**Pro tip:** Create columns for `name`, `email`, `company`, `submitted_at`, and `status`. The first four auto-populate from FormGuard. Use `status` for manual pipeline tracking (New → Contacted → Qualified → Won/Lost).

## Step 3: Set Up Notion Sync (2 minutes)

If your team runs on Notion, every lead should also appear there:

1. Create a Notion database with properties matching your form fields
2. Create a Notion integration (Settings → Integrations → New Integration)
3. Share the database with your integration
4. In FormGuard: paste your Notion Integration Token and Database ID
5. Save

Each submission creates a new Notion page with all form data populated. Your team can add notes, assign owners, and track follow-ups directly in Notion.

## Step 4: Enable Real-Time Alerts (1 minute)

### Telegram (Recommended for Founders/Solo)

1. Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Get your chat ID
3. In FormGuard: paste Bot Token + Chat ID in the Telegram integration
4. Save

Every submission → instant push notification on your phone with full submission data.

### Slack (Recommended for Teams)

Connect FormGuard's webhook to Slack:

1. Create an Incoming Webhook in Slack
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Paste it in FormGuard's webhook field

Submissions appear in your chosen Slack channel instantly. Your sales team can discuss and assign leads in-thread.

## Step 5: Auto-Responder via Webhook (3 minutes)

This is the highest-impact step. Responding within 5 minutes makes you **100x more likely** to connect with a lead.

### Using Zapier

1. In Zapier: Create a new Zap
2. Trigger: **Webhooks by Zapier → Catch Hook**
3. Copy the webhook URL → paste in FormGuard's webhook field
4. Action: **Email by Zapier** (or Resend, SendGrid, Mailchimp)
5. Configure the email:

```
To: {{email}}
Subject: Thanks for reaching out, {{name}}! Here's your next step

Body:
Hey {{name}},

Thanks for your interest in [Product]! We received your
message and a team member will follow up within 2 hours.

In the meantime, here's a quick overview of what we offer:

If you'd like to skip the line, book a demo directly:
→ [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Using Make (Formerly Integromat)

1. New Scenario → Custom Webhook
2. Copy URL → paste in FormGuard
3. Add Email module → configure template
4. Add conditional logic: if `company` field contains "@enterprise.com", route to enterprise sales team

### Using n8n (Self-Hosted)

1. Webhook node → POST
2. Copy production URL → paste in FormGuard
3. IF node: route by form type or company size
4. Email node: send personalized response
5. HTTP node: push to your CRM API

## The Complete Pipeline

Once set up, here's what happens when a prospect submits your form:

| Time  | Event                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0ms   | Prospect clicks "Submit"                 |
| 45ms  | FormGuard validates + checks spam (edge) |
| 100ms | Submission saved to database             |
| 100ms | Prospect sees success message            |
| 200ms | Google Sheets row added                  |
| 300ms | Notion page created                      |
| 500ms | Telegram notification sent               |
| 500ms | Slack message posted                     |
| 1s    | Webhook fires to Zapier/Make             |
| 3s    | Auto-response email sent to prospect     |

**Total time from submit to auto-response: 3 seconds.** Your prospect gets an email before they've left the page.

## Advanced: Lead Scoring

Use FormGuard's AI insights (Pro plan) to automatically score and prioritize leads:

The AI analyzes submission patterns and surfaces signals like:

- **High-intent indicators:** Mentions of "pricing", "demo", "enterprise", "timeline"
- **Company signals:** Enterprise email domains, company names, team size mentions
- **Urgency signals:** Words like "ASAP", "this week", "budget approved"

Review these insights in your dashboard and route high-priority leads to your senior sales team.

## Measuring Pipeline Performance

Track these metrics weekly:

| Metric                | Target      | How to Measure           |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Form conversion rate  | >5%         | FormGuard analytics      |
| Response time         | <5 min      | Auto-responder timestamp |
| Lead-to-meeting rate  | >15%        | CRM tracking             |
| Meeting-to-close rate | >25%        | CRM tracking             |
| Pipeline value        | Growing MoM | Sheets/Notion data       |

FormGuard's AI insights automatically track the first metric and surface trends. For the others, your CRM data combined with the Google Sheets pipeline provides a complete picture.

## Why This Pipeline Wins

1. **Zero manual work** — every step is automated
2. **Instant response** — prospects get acknowledged in seconds, not hours
3. **Clean data** — spam is filtered before it enters your pipeline
4. **Full visibility** — every lead is tracked in Sheets + Notion + your CRM
5. **Scalable** — handles 10 or 10,000 leads/month without changes

Most importantly: **it works while you sleep.** A prospect in any timezone, at any hour, gets the same instant, professional response and enters your pipeline with zero human intervention.
