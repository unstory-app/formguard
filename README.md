# FormGuard

**Edge-Powered AI Form Backend for Builders**

Stop building form backends. Ship faster with a single endpoint that captures submissions, blocks spam, and converts raw responses into clear AI insights.

Built using **Cloudflare Workers, Next.js App Router, StackAuth, shadcn/ui, and Dodo Payments** — optimized for speed, simplicity, and high profit margins.

# Overview

FormGuard is a developer-first SaaS that replaces traditional form infrastructure with a lightweight edge API and a minimal dashboard.

Instead of building:

- backend APIs
- validation layers
- analytics pipelines
- messy CSV workflows

You create a form, copy an endpoint, and start receiving structured insights instantly.

# Getting Started

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appedme/formguard
cd formguard
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

We use **Bun** for maximum performance.

```bash
bun install
```

## 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` based on `.env.example`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID=
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
```

## 4. Run Development Server

```bash
bun dev
```

## 5. Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare via GitHub Actions or Wrangler:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

---

# How It Works

1. **Create a Form**: Get a unique `endpointId` from the dashboard.
2. **Post Data**: Send POST requests to `https://formguard.unstory.app/api/submit/:endpointId`.
3. **Analyze**: Use the AI Insight engine to summarize 100s of responses in seconds.

---

# Philosophy

FormGuard is built for builders who want:

- **Zero infra**: Just drop an endpoint.
- **Clear feedback**: AI-summarized insights, not raw data.
- **Global scale**: Runs on the edge.

One endpoint. Clean insights. Ship faster.
